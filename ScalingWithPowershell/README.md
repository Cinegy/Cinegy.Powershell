These are the PowerShell files we demo'd at Cinegy TechCon 2016 - in their full, working form.

Also included is the PowerShell script we used to change the output mutlicast address for our scripted, mass-launched Multiviewers - it's a great little script that lets you see how to read IP address details from a machine, and manipulate an XML file from inside PowerShell.

The 'extended' scripts take the original, and add some little extra bonus bits we felt were fun over time - since we actually use these scripts.

For help understanding how they work, best look at the Cinegy Open post about Scaling with Powershell at http://open.cinegy.com.

Have fun with them!
